        <h2>Geometrisk font</h2>

        

        <p>
          The display font of my choice is called Geometrisk. The typeface was designed by the founder of <a href="https://brokstad.studio" class="fontcolor">Brokstad Studio</a>, Daniel Brokstad. 
          It is a virtual design studio, that works with freelancers depending on which projects they receive. 
          It was founded in 2020, but already has some fine projects to its name, mainly posters and font designs. 
        </p>
  
        <p>
          What I love about Geometrisk is the fact that it is very innovative. 
          The unique combination of the angular and round elements looks very nice to me. 
          There are also some cool details, such as the cutouts in some letters and the italics, that kind of look as if they were chopped into pieces.
