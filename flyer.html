            <h2>Antwerp Art Weekend 2021 flyer</h2>
            <p>
                My favourite flyer is this one, that was designed for Antwerp Art Weekend 2021, which took place from the 13th till the 16th of May. 
                Itâ€™s an event that is organised each year, by the organisation Antwerp Art. 
                Almost all Antwerp museums, theatres and galleries celebrate Antwerp as an artistic city, by organising exhibitions, guided walks, performances and much more. 
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Studio <a href="http://vrints-kolsteren.com" class="flyercolor">Vrints-Kolsteren</a>, founded by Vincent Vrints and Naomi Kolsteren, is responsible for the design every year. 
                The event has been running since 2015 and the flyers match up very nicely. 
                Each year, they are very graphic and typographic and there is a recurring element of a diagonal line.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                The use of that line in the design for this edition is one of the reasons why I am such a fan of this flyer. 
                The fact that the line creates a sort of negative side on the front and back, is a very cool effect in my opinion. 
                It's also nice that this diagonal returns in the 20/21. 
                The colour palette is also very cool. The unexpected combination of the bright blue and yellow with the sober brown and cream works surprisingly well. 
                There is a lot of information on the flyer, yet it still looks balanced.
