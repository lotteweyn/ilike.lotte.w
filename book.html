            <h2>Nopi book cover</h2>
            <p>
                The cover of Ottolenghi's and Ramael Scolly's Nopi, is one of my favorites. 
                In think the front cover, back cover, spine and edge painting all fit together very beautifully. 
                Because of the simple colors, the gold details can really stand out. For example the recurring element of the golden O. 
                The fact that the back of the book represents the back of the pan, is an interesting choice in my opinion.
                I also really like the font that they used. The fact that it is very light and wide at the same time, makes it look very attractive.

                The book was designed by the London based multi-disciplinary design studio <a href="https://www.heredesign.co.uk" class="bookcolor">Here Design </a >. 
                The studio defines itself as a company of thinkers, writers, designers and makers. 
                In the past, they have already worked with many major brands and institutions, such as The British Library, Bacardi and Tate Modern.
