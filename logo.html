            <h2>Rush Rush logo</h2>

            <p>
                The logo I chose is that of <a href="https://rushrush.be" class="logocolor">Rush Rush </a>, a new Antwerp based coffee roastery and caf√©. 
                The entire brand identity is designed by <a href="http://www.florismachiels.be" class="logocolor">Floris Machiels</a>, who used the font Futurespore. 
                Futurespore is a typeface made by typographer Andrew Young of Disaster Fonts.

                I think it's very interesting that the logo can be viewed horizontally as well as vertically. 
                This also allows it to be used very flexibly, for example in prints for the brand's packaging. 
                The way the glyphs hang together creates a very smooth and spontaneous feel. I also think it just looks very cool.
